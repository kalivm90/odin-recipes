# odin-recipes
Recipes project from The Odin Project

This project is a recipe page where mainly HTML will be used and then later styled with CSS. I already have a pretty good grasp on HTML and will be doing these projects with the applied knowledge I have learned along the way including the info I have learned from the Odin Project.

For later:
    What have you learned?
